                            Python first appeared back in February 20th, 1991 by a Dutch programmer 
                            named Guido van Rossum. He initially created Python because he wanted to create
                            a project that would keep him occupied during the week of Christmas back in 1989.
                            Guido wanted to develop a language similar like ABC, which was a language he had
                            worked on previously, with the goal of being able to interact with the OS and
                            developing OS utilities unlike ABC. <br><br>
                            
                            
                            After some time, Python was gaining some momentum as programmers were getting tired of writing C programs or Unix shell programs for their
                            tasks. People began to help out by providing feedback, bug fixes, and other ways to help
                            improve the language itself. <br><br>
                            
                            Now, Python can be found everywhere from websites to games
                            and will continue to do so for a while as Python is a very accessible language that any
                            new or veteran programmers can delve into.
