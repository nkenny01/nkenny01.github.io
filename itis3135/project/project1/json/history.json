		"info1": "Python first appeared back in February 20th, 1991 by a Dutch programmer named Guido van Rossum. He initially created Python because he wanted to create a project that would keep him occupied during the week of Christmas back in 1989. Guido wanted to develop a language similar like ABC, which was a language he had worked on previously, with the goal of being able to interact with the OS and developing OS utilities unlike ABC.",
		"info2": "After some time, Python was gaining some momentum as programmers were getting tired of writing C programs or Unix shell programs for their tasks. People began to help out by providing feedback, bug fixes, and other ways to help improve the language itself.",
		"info3": "Now, Python can be found everywhere from websites to games and will continue to do so for a while as Python is a very accessible language that any new or veteran programmers can delve into."
