                    Welcome to my homepage where I get to talk about my love for swimming! Feel free to look around by
                    clicking on the navigation bar above with all sorts of stuff related to swimming. From my personal history
                    to all of the different strokes, this website is all about learning about swimming and my personal background
                    behind these strokes. Hopefully, I can get you to try swimming out if you're not already doing so.

                    I first began swimming when I was 7 years old. It was the summer going into 2nd grade
                    when my Dad drove me to the pool with my cousin thinking we were going there for fun.
                    However, my dad had other plans for us and signed us up for the summer swim team without us
                    knowing. We didn't have a choice so we decided to stick with it. On my first day, me and my
                    cousin were already passing kids from the age groups above ours even though we had joined 
                    late compared to them. We won many ribbons and medals from the swim meets and 
                    it was always fun. I joined the swim team every summer afterwards until middle school
                    came along. I got bored of the sport and was more interested in Tae Kwon Do instead so I ended taking up
                    taking a massive break from swimming until I came back in high school. <br><br>

                    Once high school came along, my Dad once again forced me to join even though I hated swimming 
                    at this point. On my first day, I was the slowest in my group 
                    and slower than the age groups below me. I wanted out of the team but I decided to stick with it until
                    it ended. By the end, I was still slow but it did manage to bring back my love for swimming again. Now,
                    I like to swim casually as I don't want a hobby of mine to feel forced but instead be something
                    I enjoy.

                    Freestyle is one of the main four competitive swimming strokes and the most common stroke
                    you see people use when they are casually swimming. Freestyle is a stroke where your arms
                    come up above water and essentially "pulling" yourself forward against the water and stretching
                    your entire body forward for extended reach while also repeatedly kicking your legs up and down.

                    <br><br>

                    Freestyle has always been my favorite stroke as it was my best stroke and overall just fun to perform.
                    It was also fun to watch as freestyle took the least amount of time compared to the others but was always
                    intense as swimmers were always going toe-to-toe with each other. It also translates into casual swimming
                    as people only use freestyle when swimming.

                    Breaststroke is one of the main four competitive swimming strokes. Breaststroke is a stroke where
                    you have your hands near your chest underwater and you thrust it forward. After this,
                    you bring your arms back to starting position near your chest by "splitting the water". 
                    With kicking, you kick your legs outwards and bring it back by straightening it out first
                    and then slighly bending the knee so that the foot is above your knee.

                    <br><br>

                    I was initially really bad at breaststroke when I was kid. I didn't understand the movement and technique
                    of breaststroke, leaving with me times slower than desired. However, as I grew older, breaststroke became
                    easier and I was able to do them easily. It really is a cool stroke to perform as you're imitating a frog (at
                    least that's the analogy my coaches used) and is always fun to watch as well.

                    </div><br>


                    Backstroke is one of the main four competitive swimming strokes. Backstroke is a stroke where
                    your back is facing towards the ground and you bring your arms up from the water near your hips
                    and bring it up all the way over until your arm grazes your head while also repeatedly kicking
                    up and down.


                    <br><br>

                    I like backstroke as it was always cool to see how people can get such great times while also being 
                    elegant in the sense that the water was hardly splashing but rather "gliding" with them. Only thing I don't 
                    like about backstroke is the fact that water can easily go up your nose and make you start coughing if your
                    body falls too low under the water.

                    </div> <br>


                    Butterfly is one of the main four competitive swimming strokes. Butterfly is a stroke where
                    you bring both arms forward simutaneously and kicking "Dolphin" style, where you keep your legs
                    together.

                    <br><br>

                    Butterfly was always my least favorite. It's the stroke that requires the most strength and endurance out
                    of you and would always tire me out. Whenever I would go look at my replays that someone had recorded 
                    during this event, I would look like a flopping fish trying to get to finish line. It also sucked because it
                    was the first stroke during the individual medley or IM and performing butterfly always puts me in a bad mood.
