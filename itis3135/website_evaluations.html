            <ol>
                <li>C: The page blends darker backgrounds with lighter font colors to help bring out
                       visibility for viewers to see.
                </li>

                <li>R: There is a very good sense of repetition used on the home page. For example, 
                       Throughout the page, there is very few fonts and colors but they are all reused 
                       in some form.</li>
                
                <li>A: Everything is perfectly aligned with each other. For example, the text, headings, 
                       and images are perfectly aligned to the left, making it visually easy to read.</li>
                
                <li>P: The website follows proximity very well. The potential vacation spots are grouped together
                       and support services are all grouped together at the bottom of the page.
                </li>
            </ol> 

        <a href='https://www.lingscars.com/'>Bad Website: Ling's Cars</a>
        <p>Ling's Cars is a UK based car leasing website containing info about cars, prices, etc</p>
            <ol>
                <li>C: There are many elements that stand out to the point where it affects readability. </li>
                
                <li>R: While there is some repetition, there are a bunch of design elements that 
                       don't follow the repetition such as the words displayed next to the cars.</li>
                
                <li>A: There are many images that affect the alignment of the page as there are 
                       pictures of random cars and goofy images of Ling all over the page.</li>
                
                <li>P: One good thing about this page is that similar elements are grouped together.
                       However, the spacing between them is so far apart that it becomes hard to the 
                       point where you must scroll all the way down to gather information.
                </li>
            </ol>
