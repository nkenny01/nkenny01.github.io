         <h2>Course Contract</h2>
         <p>

            I, Kenny D. Nguyen agree to abide by the terms of the course 
            contract in my Spring 2022, ITSC-3135: Web App Design and 
            Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        

        <p>   
        I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online 
            tools will be available to the world, and will not put information 
            there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p> 

        <p>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not 
            logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may 
            show as absences.
</p>

<p>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s 
            possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code 
            directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will 
            not cut and paste code except where i have properly given credit 
            (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
