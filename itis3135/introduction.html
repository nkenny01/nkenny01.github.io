         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         
         <p>Name: Kenny Nguyen </p>
         
         <p>
             <strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am a first-generation college student majoring in Computer Science
                                  at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Originally, I was
                                  born in Vietnam and moved over to New York at a very young age. Once
                                  I turned 6 years old, I moved over to North Carolina where I would
                                  spend most of my life. Some hobbies of mine include playing games,
                                  swimming, hanging out with friends, and watching anime.
         </p>
         
         <p>
             <strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have worked many part time jobs in my life. From an ice cream
                                      shop, waiting tables, and selling masks, I would say I have a
                                      good number of working experiences. However, my goal is to get an internship
                                      so I can enter the tech industry one day.
         </p>
         
         <p>
             <strong>Academic Background:</strong> I have attended and graduated elementary, middle, and high school and 
                                  now attending college. Part of the reason why I wanted to go to college
                                  was because I loved coding in basic Python and wanted to enhance my skills
                                  further by majoring in Computer Science
         </p>

         <p>
             <strong>Background in course:</strong> I have worked with HTML in a course I took at Rowan-Cabarrus Community
                                   College and really enjoyed what I was learning and making throughout
                                   that course.

             <strong>Funny story</strong>: I had a whole beach town trying to find me because my friends
