        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Kenny Nguyen</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am a first-generation college student majoring in Computer Science
          at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Originally, I was
          born in Vietnam and moved over to New York at a very young age. Once
          I turned 6 years old, I moved over to North Carolina where I would
          spend most of my life. Some hobbies of mine include playing games,
          swimming, hanging out with friends, and watching anime.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have worked many part time jobs in my life. From an ice cream
          shop, waiting tables, and selling masks, I would say I have a
          good number of working experiences. However, my goal is to get an internship
          so I can enter the tech industry one day.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Academic Background:</strong> I have attended and graduated elementary, middle, and high school and
          now attending college. Part of the reason why I wanted to go to college
          was because I loved coding in basic Python and wanted to enhance my skills
          further by majoring in Computer Science.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Background in course:</strong> I have worked with HTML in a course I took at Rowan-Cabarrus Community
          College and really enjoyed what I was learning and coding throughout
          that course.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Primary Computer Platform</strong> PC and Laptop</p>


        <p><strong>Courses Taking (Spring 2022):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>ITSC-3135: Web App Design and Development: A required course but looking forward to learning HTML</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Funny story</strong>: I had a whole beach town search for me because my friends
          jokingly told them that they were looking for a "5'9 Vietnamese man who can't speak English and was
          exiled from Vietnam" while I was out on a date during my senior graduation beach trip.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Other Stuff:</strong> I'm already having fun with HTML and I have only just started</p>
